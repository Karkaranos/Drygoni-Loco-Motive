At the absolute minimum, put your game name, team name, class name and section (IM289, for example) and best contact email address at the beginning of the file.

 

That’s all that is required, but this is the only thing that will be read before your game is played, so if you need to say anything about controls, cheat codes/keys, bugs, known crashes, gameplay tips, whatever, say it here.

 

Information about controls, gameplay, etc. should be in the game itself, but if it isn’t (or is wrong/misleading in some way), then put it here.
